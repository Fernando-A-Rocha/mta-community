# Contributing to the MTA Community Platform

Thank you for your interest in helping us rebuild and expand the MTA community platform (`community.multitheftauto.com`). The goal is to preserve all existing capabilities while delivering new features, improved performance, and a modernized UI/UX. Every contribution—code, design, documentation, or feedback—helps us deliver a better experience for the MTA community.

## Ways to Contribute

- **Bug reports & issues:** Tell us what is broken, confusing, or missing. Attach screenshots, reproduction steps, and logs whenever possible.
- **Feature ideas & UX improvements:** Describe the use case, outline expected behavior, and explain why it benefits the community.
- **Code contributions:** Fix bugs, implement new functionality, improve tests, or polish documentation.
- **Design & accessibility feedback:** Highlight opportunities to make the interface clearer, faster, and more inclusive.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork and clone** this repository.
2. **Set up the project**: follow `README.md` for environment setup.
3. **Create a feature branch** from `main` using a descriptive name, e.g. `feature/profile-search` or `fix/avatar-upload`.
4. **Sync regularly** with `main` to avoid large merge conflicts.

## Development Workflow

1. **Open an issue (or comment on an existing one)** to discuss significant changes before building.
2. **Implement the change** with clean, self-documenting code. Favor Laravel best practices, typed PHP (`declare(strict_types=1);`), good design principles.
3. **Add/Update tests** that cover the new behavior. Include seeders/factories if data is required.
4. **Run the full test suite & linters** before pushing.
5. Write **Documentation**

## Pull Request Guidelines

- **Reference the related issue** in the PR description (`Fixes #123`).
- **Describe the change set** (what, why, screenshots if UI-related, and testing performed).
- **Keep PRs focused**; large unrelated changes slow reviews.
- **Ensure at least one reviewer** from the maintainers signs off before merging. No self-merges without review.
- **Resolve review feedback promptly**. Clarify decisions with reviewers when necessary.

## Community Expectations

- Be respectful and collaborative; welcome newcomers.
- Assume positive intent and focus on solutions.
- Follow open-source etiquette: respond within a reasonable time, keep discussions on-topic, and credit contributors.

By following these guidelines, you help us deliver a modern, feature-rich community hub for every MTA player and creator. We appreciate your time and contributions!
